Initial notes to get started on prep for CSE-299

Initial ideas:

Chatbot:
using RAG, web scraping, and/database connector library, or otherwise, 
that can pull data from RDS and help students advise, create schedules, and solve basic queries (related to NSU).

LLM Models considered:
- Llama 3.1
- Phi3 mini (lightweight)
(NO UNCENSORED MODELS/WEIGHTFILES LIKE DOLPHIN)

if possible:
- add image detection using models like Llava 3.1.

add frontend using react, or frontend implementations you already know to create an app, like using Java's swing or something else.

concept: being prepared and in files.
