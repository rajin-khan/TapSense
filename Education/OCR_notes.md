## **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) in a nutshell:**

OCR, or **Optical Character Recognition**, is a technology that allows computers to "read" and understand text from images. When an image is captured (*whether it's a handwritten note, a printed page, or a digital document*) the computer only sees **shapes, colors, and patterns**. OCR steps in to analyze these shapes (*letters, numbers, etc.*) and converts them into actual editable text that we can work with.
